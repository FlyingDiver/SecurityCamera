This plugin is designed to be used for security cameras that provide
access to a refreshing image file.  Although it was designed with Security 
Cameras in mind it should work with any refreshing image file.

Security Camera requires the Python Image Library module to be installed.  To install 
run the following from the terminal: 

		'sudo pip install Pillow' .


See the manual for instructions on setting and using the plugin.
